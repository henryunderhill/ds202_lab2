```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)

hist(choco$Rating, breaks = 20)
plot(x=choco$Rating, y=choco$Cocoa.Pct)
abline(lm(choco$Cocoa.Pct ~ choco$Rating))
```

1. There isn't too much of a relationship between cocoa percent and rating. There are outliers at high rated chocolate percents and ratings of 1 and 5.

2. Not really due to the lack of much of a relationship.
