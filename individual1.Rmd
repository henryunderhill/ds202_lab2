#individual questions 1 and 2
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)

hist(choco$Rating, breaks = 20)
plot(x = choco$Rating, y = choco$Cocoa.Pct)
abline(lm(choco$Cocoa.Pct ~ choco$Rating))
```

The histogram for rating is centered around 2.75 to 3.5. There are outliers at ratings of 1 and 5, respectively. 
When looking at the scatterplot, there is a very weak negative trend between cocoa percentage and rating. The relationship is basically non-existent. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
