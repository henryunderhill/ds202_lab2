Interesting question: What location has the best chocolate (based off of rating and company location)?

# 5
```{r}
library(dplyr)
                 
data <- choco %>%
  group_by(choco$Company.Location) %>%
  summarise(averageRating = mean(Rating))

# print(data)
print("best chocolate is in: ")
data[order("averageRating")][[1]][[1]]

```

Workflow: I'm unsure what Workflow means in this case. When it comes to writing code and the workflow associated with that, R Markdown is really easy to use to test increments of code instead of testing all code at once. A lot of this involved a lot of Google research and incrementally building out our solution from there.
